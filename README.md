Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Diwali Sales dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The dataset contains various customer information, including age, gender, marital status, occupation, and product purchases. The goal of this analysis is to uncover hidden trends, outliers, correlations, and other important aspects of the data.


Project Structure


The project is structured as follows:

Exploratory_Data_Analysis-Diwali_Sales.ipynb:
Jupyter notebooks used for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis.


Output:
Folder for storing images generated during the analysis.

Readme.md:
This file, providing an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions for running the analysis.

Diwali Sales Data.csv: 
The dataset file.
